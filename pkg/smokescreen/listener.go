// einhornListener is a net.Listener that will send an ACK to the einhorn
// master the first time its Accept method is called.
//
// Its implementation leaves a short time window between the sending the ACK
// and when a thread is actively blocked by an Accept syscall. Because there is
// a gap here it is possible for the process to freeze/crash/etc and never
// reach the Accept call. This may lead to sadness because of dropped
// connections (if the accept queue overflows) or timeouts because nothing
// realized this process died.
//
// The alternatives to work around this are complex, introduce concurrency and
// create several new classes of errors. So I've erred on the side of
// simplicity and am hoping that by moving the ACK as close to the Accept as
// possible we'll avoid too much pain.
